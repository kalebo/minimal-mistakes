                        Lauren and Kaleb first met in Provo during the fall of 2016. They worked closely together as family history co-chairs in their BYU student ward; as they worked they discovered that they enjoyed each other's company more and more. Four (long) months after meeting, they went on their first date. Lauren thought that Kaleb couldn't have planned a cuter evening. They spent the night coloring at the Provo City Library, and found that it was easy to talk to each other. They discovered many common interests and felt natural in each other's company.
                    </p>
                        <p>A month later they decided they would date exclusively. Fast forward through a fun summer of dating, the couple shared their first sweet kiss on the doorstep in early August. Things really started going after that, and they spent more and more time together, and in February of 2017 they decided they wanted to spend forever together. Kaleb asked Lauren to be his eternal sweetheart on March 18, 2017 in Payson, Utah. The couple will be sealed for time and all eternity in the Payson, Utah Temple on June 30, 2017.
